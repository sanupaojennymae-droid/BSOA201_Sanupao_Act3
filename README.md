1. What color choices did you make and why?

- I chose purple and white for a clean, modern look, with black fonts for the clarity of the word. Purple highlights the important elements, white keeps the background and layout organized, and black ensures all text is easy to read. It ensure the professionalism and user-friendly of the Office Announcement Portal.

2. How did you apply accessibility fixes?

- I made the portal easier for everyone to use by picking high-contrast colors, easy-to-read fonts, simple navigation, and adding descriptions for images so anyone can read updates and get around the site without problems. 

3. What challenges did you face?

- While creating the Office Announcement Portal, it was difficult at first because I wasn’t familiar with how to use WordPress and how to operate and edit it. But after exploring the website, I was able to use it properly and eventually choose a template that fit what I wanted for my website.
